				This app aims to provide users with some tools to perform simple experiements to supplement their
				learning for EE2010 Signals and Systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				The experiements in this app are arranged specifically in such a way to demonstrate, progressively,
				effects of signals and systems. The sequence is as follow:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b><a href="oscillator.html">Oscillator</a></b> is essentially a function generator to showcase the
					generation of the basic blocks of sound. Also a handy tool to check how a function sounds like.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b><a href="playback.html">Playback</a></b> allows users to control the playback rate of an audio
					sample to showcase a speed control system and the physical effects of manipulating frequency.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b><a href="filters.html">Filters</a></b> take systems one step further to showcase different kinds
					of input signal manipulation.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b><a href="voice.html">Voice</a></b> allows users to use their own voices to be passed through a
					predefined system and observe effects in realtime.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This app is not meant to replace any part of EE2010.
			</p>

			<h3>Message from author</h3>
			<p>
				I believe EE2010 is one of the more important modules for EEE students as the concepts introduced in
				this module is deployed in most advanced topics, such as modelling, control, network, signal processing,
				machine learning, computer vision and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				The overarching idea may be simple, but it still is beneficial for someone to explicitly point out just
				why all these concepts matter and how these concepts are applied in real life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's look at how these concepts can be transferred to other modules:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Computing</b> every function that you write is essentially a system. If your function requires an
					input parameter and returns an output, those are your input and output signals. Same effect if a
					global variable is not inputted but is manipulated.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Analog Electronics</b>: the entire module is about operational amplifier, which is a system to
					amplify input signals to obtain desired output signals. Also can be configured as filters.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Digital Electronics</b>: a system comprising logic gates to control input signals to obtain
					desired output signals.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Mathematics</b>: every function is a system, every variable is a signal.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Data Structure and Algorithms</b>: a collections of systems and how to improve their performance.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				While these analogies may not seem immediately obvious and certainly isn't formal representative of
				those topics, the author wishes to present this idea abstractly to help students new to this topic to
				gain <b>awareness</b> of where this course might lead you to.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for all formal definitions and equations, please refer to your textbook and lecture notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enjoy!
			</p>

			<h3>Note</h3>
			<p>
				iOS has an incredibly rich history of setting their own standards and thus you may find that some
				experiments will not run. Try visiting this app from a computer share an Android device with a friend.
